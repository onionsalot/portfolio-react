I've always felt that my CSS was my weakness and so I set out to try to rectify that. What better way to improve one's CSS than to make a deeply personal site, such as a portfolio!

I set out to make something that screams -me- while making sure to rely on as little third party libraries or frameworks (looking at you, bootstrap) as possible.

## Technologies Used:

- React, Javascript, SCSS, HTML
